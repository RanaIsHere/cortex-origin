Cortex: Origin is a sequel to my first ever game made with Godot named Unextinguished. It tells of a story about Earth running out of resource, our protagonist, seeks out the impossible and must return to the past before the resource shortage ever happened. Although, he accidentally sent himself over millenias ago before humanity ever existed on Earth.
