# cortex-origin
Cortex: Origin is a sequel to my first ever game made with Godot named Unextinguished. Made with Godot. 

# Game:
A top-down survival game with choices. Make time your ally or your enemy, survive in a hand-made world and staving off starvation, thirst, along with one surprising mechanic. Anomaly Meter, a dangerous meter that increases or decreases depending on your choice (as that choice will depends on what situation you are in.)

# Plot:
It tells of a story about Earth running out of resource, our protagonist, seeks out the impossible and must return to the past before the resource shortage ever happened. Although, he accidentally sent himself over millenias ago before humanity ever existed on Earth. Now he intends to do the impossible and return back from when he came from, and where he came from.

However, one little problem has surfaced. Anomaly runs rampant on the surface of the Earth, a result of the rule that he accidentally breached to go so far into the past. How should he survive in a world filled with dangers?
